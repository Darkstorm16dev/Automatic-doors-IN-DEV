# Automatic-doors-IN-DEV

This is an open-source project aimed at developing a bot to beat the "DOORS" game on Roblox. The goal is to create an intelligent bot that can navigate through the hotel, detect enemies, find keys, and interact with doors effectively.

## About the Project

Hi, I'm Darkstorm16, a solo developer working on this project. One day, I thought it would be interesting to create a bot to beat "DOORS" in Roblox, and thus, this project was born. This bot is designed to handle various in-game challenges such as enemy detection, pathfinding, key retrieval, and more.

## Features

- **Enemy Detection**: The bot can detect enemies like Rush and Ambush using sound recognition.
- **Pathfinding**: The bot uses Roblox's PathfindingService to navigate through the game environment.
- **Key Finding**: The bot searches for keys in rooms to unlock doors.
- **Closet Hiding**: The bot can hide in closets to avoid enemies.
- **Logging System**: A UI-based logging system to visualize the bot's actions and states.
- **Compatibility Check**: Ensures the script runs only in the "DOORS" game.

## Current Status

- **Enemy Detection**: Non-functional (requires testing and debugging).
- **Pathfinding**: In development (issues with waypoint accuracy).
- **Key Finding**: In development (bugged).
- **Closet Hiding**: Non-functional (requires testing and debugging).

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Darkstorm16dev/Automatic-doors-IN-DEV.git

    ```

2. **Open in Roblox Studio**:
    - Open Roblox Studio.
    - Load the project files and scripts into your game.

3. **Run the Script**:
    - Ensure you are in the "DOORS" game.
    - Inject the script and observe the bot's actions through the logging UI.

## Q&A

**Q: Is this code made by GPT?**
